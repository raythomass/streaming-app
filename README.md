# Movie and TV Streaming App

## Description

This application acts a streaming app that is capable of streaming almost any movie or tv show. By selecting a movie or tv show from their respective trending page, or searching through the search page, users are redirected to a page that gives them more details and information based on their selection. Using The Movie Database API allowed me to fetch a mass amount of data that makes this application possible. This project is still currently a work in progress so there is more to come in terms of functionality such as dynmaically rendered tv show seasons and user login funtionality./
The motivation behind this project was to practice and refine my React skills as well as understanding how to better fetch data from an API and render the information into the application. Throughout this project I was constantly learning how to better manipulate the data to display the information I wanted as well as learning new React hooks.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
